We show how carefully replicating data blocks and coding across gradients can provide tolerance to failures and stragglers for synchronous Gradient Descent. We implement our schemes in python (using MPI) to run on Amazon EC2, and show how we compare against baseline approaches in running time and generalization error.}

abstract = {We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers $1.73 x communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98 x expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.},

It characterizes the fundamental tradeoff to compute gradients in terms of three parameters: computation load, straggler tolerance and communication cost. It further gives an explicit coding scheme that achieves the optimal tradeoff based on recursive polynomial constructions, coding both across data subsets and vector components. As a result, the proposed scheme allows to minimize the running time for gradient computations. Implementations are made on Amazon EC2 clusters using Python with mpi4py package. Results show that the proposed scheme maintains the same generalization error while reducing the running time by $32\% $ compared to uncoded schemes and $23\%$ compared to prior coded schemes focusing only on stragglers (Tandon et al., ICML 2017).}

  abstract = 	 {In a large-scale and distributed matrix multiplication problem $C=A^{\intercal}B$, where $C\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times t}$, the coded computation plays an important role to effectively deal with “stragglers” (distributed computations that may get delayed due to few slow or faulty processors). However, existing coded schemes could destroy the significant sparsity that exists in large-scale machine learning problems, and could result in much higher computation overhead, i.e., $O(rt)$ decoding time. In this paper, we develop a new coded computation strategy, we call <em>sparse code</em>, which achieves near <em>optimal recovery threshold</em>, <em>low computation overhead</em>, and <em>linear decoding time</em> $O(nnz(C))$. We implement our scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the approach over both uncoded and current fastest coded strategies.}
