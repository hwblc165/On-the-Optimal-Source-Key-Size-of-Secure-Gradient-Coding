# On-the-Optimal-Source-Key-Size-of-Secure-Gradient-Coding
This repository is dedicated to managing the journal versions of our paper submitted to ISIT 2025. In this work, we explore a more generalized distributed model known as Distributed Linearly Separable Computation, which extends beyond traditional gradient coding frameworks. Our analysis not only addresses the source key size but also investigates the individual key size in scenarios where the demand task is unknown.
