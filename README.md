# On-the-Optimal-Source-Key-Size-of-Secure-Gradient-Coding
Repository for managing journal versions of our ISIT 2025 paper submission.
Actually, we have discuss a more general distributed model: Distributed Linearly Separable Computation, which covers the gradient coding. We not only discuss the source key size but also individual key size unknown the demand task.
